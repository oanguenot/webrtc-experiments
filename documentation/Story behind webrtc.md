This document is my personal understanding of how the WebrRTC technology has emerged from browser. I'm not from Google but the main information I found is related to Google and Chrome because they have a clear WebRTC release notes.

## The codecs war

Microsoft is still isolated with its own implementation of WebRTC (Orca). For Chrome and Firefox, and codecs providers, a battle is engaged to decide on the mandatory codecs to support on WebRTC end point (browsers). At the end, this is a status-quo: H264 and VP8 needs to be implemented for the video codecs and G711 and Opus for the audio codecs. Browsers are free to propose additionals codecs.

## Developers want homogeneous API

As for browsers at the origin for JavaScript and HTML, WebRTC developers want API that are homogenous against browsers. Hopefully, browsers wendors have listened and little by little, the specifications are implemented in the same maner in all browsers... But there are still differences today! Other victory, WebRTC finally landed in Safari!
