# Introduction

WebRTC is a technology that exists since 2012 and that has been little by little adopted by application makers.

WebRTC lets you build application in which users will be able to have discuss using voice and video as well as to share their screen or to record the calls. So today, there is no limit for application's makers to propose collaboration and social applications "in live" with two or more participants.

Even if now, WebRTC has been largely adopted by browsers and platforms, in the past, this as been different. It tooks time, sometime like in a "drama" or "triller" movie with some betrayals, surprises and come-backs, to reach that level. Concurrency between browsers vendors was fierce during some years. But as for other technologies before, the reason and the fact that some organizations like the **W3C** succeeded to gather and federate the protagonists, allowed this technology to emerge and to be adopted today by a lot of developers.

## Objectives

The objectives of that documentation is multiple.

First, I want to share my knowledge and continue to progress by discovering some "hidden parts" in order to develop the best applications I can. And secondly, I want to share some advices because often the documentation gives you an "academic" training of overview but no return of experiences. I want to share some of them to let you understand the bad or complicated points.

In a lot of paragraph, I have added a section _Recommendations_ where I share my own experience. This is only some advices. Sometimes, they will match with yours but sometimes not. But in all cases, I hope that they will help you.

## Audience

I written that documentation for Web developers without any knowledge of **WebRTC**. I tried to explain that technology with _common_ terms. Don't hesitate to complete the reading by other sources you can find on Internet. The [Mozilla Resources site for Developers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and the [WebRTC.org](https://webrtc.org/) web site are two great sources of information. But others exist, just try...

## Me

I'm a french developer based near Strasbourgn France. I developed a lot of applications based on WebRTC since 2012. Sometimes, for me, just to understand how it works but often for my company.

## English wordings

English is not my mother tongue. I think you already seen that point...

Don't hesitate to help me fixing some **English's issues** by proposing some merge-requests. Your help will be really appreciated!
