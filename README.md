# WebRTC Experiments

This application and the associated documentation try to centralize information around **WebRTC** which is a technology adopted by many applications today. But often, a technology where developers are confused when they have to use it because of the difference between implementations in browsers.

On my own, as I didn't find these information somewhere. I tried to sum-up my experiments and advices here.

For that I created a WebRTC application and the associated server. This application demonstrates most of what is written in the documentation part.

## Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To launch it, just clone the repository and then

```shell

yarn install

```

Once all dependencies have been downloaded, launch the server

```shell

node server/server.js

```

and then launch the application

```shell

yarn start

```

## Documentation

All the documentation is splitten into different chapters:

-   [Chapter 1: Access to devices](./documentation/Chapter%201%20-%20Access%20to%20devices.md)
